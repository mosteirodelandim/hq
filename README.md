<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## What do I do?

Just take a gander through the [issues](https://github.com/mosteirodelandim/hq/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) to see the development status of each one and relevant links for tools that were chosen or created to better manage the Mosteiro.
